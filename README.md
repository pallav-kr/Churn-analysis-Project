It’s easier to keep an existing customer than to gain a new one, and it’s much simpler to save a departing customer than to tempt them back later.

In this Code Pattern, I have used PowerBI and Excel to solve a business problem and predict customer churn using the Telco customer churn dataset.


## Objectives
The model can be used to calculate the churn rate and depending on the nature of business, different metrics can be used. Few common metrics are -

 Number of customers lost.

 Percent of customers lost.

 Value of recurring business lost.

 Percent of recurring value lost.


## Dataset:

The data set includes information about:

1. Customers who left – the column is called Churn.
2. Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
3. Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
4. Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

## Application

The ability to predict churn before it happens allows businesses to take proactive actions to keep existing customers from churning. 

The advantage of calculating a company's churn rate is that it provides clarity on how well the business is retaining customers, which is a reflection on the quality of the service the business is providing, as well as its usefulness.
